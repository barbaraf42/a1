        <h1>Hi, I'm Barbara!</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a front-end web developer living in the Boston, Massachusetts, area, trying to get up to speed on the rest of the web development stack. I enjoy a good challenge, but I really appreciate learning things from experienced people even more, so I'm taking this class. My two dogs keep me company while I'm coding, unless there are squirrels outside - then we switch jobs, and I keep them company outside while they chase down those fierce beasts.
